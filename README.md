# 360-degree Tours for VR, Desktop, and Mobile

WebVR is an exciting new technology that allows developers to create VR experiences that anyone can use as long as they have a browser with internet access. This project uses HTML code and a software framework called [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) to create 360-degree tours that work on desktops, on mobile phones, and in VR headsets. 

You can use mobile applications like [Google Street View](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street&hl=en) to take 360-degree photos with your phone, or for better quality you can buy dedicated 360-degree cameras for less than $300.

Three ways to use the app:
- click and drag on desktop
- open it on a smartphone and use the device motion sensors
- plug in a VR headset
